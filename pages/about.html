F.O.A.L.S. (Fallin' Off A Log Solutions)<p>
F.O.A.L.S. is a 'low-fi' idea incubator focused on creating cross-medium 
(web, smartphone, tables/iPad, print, others) solutions inspired by simple 
concepts with the central idea being around making everyday life slightly better. 
We identify and leverage ideas often missed in conversations as the fodder for new technologies and product.
<p>
With a core mission of focusing on enhancing basic tasks and/or making the mundane better, 
we strive to bring to market commercially viable ideas that, where applicable, leverage annomous 
user data to build a better understanding of how personal behaviors can be improved through the use of technologies and products.
<p>
Our solutions include:<br>
<i>Vestigo</i> - a personal asset tracking application inspired by the notion that "having everything i need" in my pocket.<br>
<i>BlockTracker<i> - a tool designed to help organize and track LEGO blocks while inspiring creative minds to design, build and collaborating with the LEGO builder community at large.<br>
<p>
F.O.A.L.S. was founded in the Fall of 2011 by Tyler Worman and Patrick Videll and co-lo acted in Ann Arbor and Philadelphia. 
Mr. Worman and Mr. Videll are former co-workers who share a passion for tracking their respective personal possessions (mostly around Music), working with LEGOs, and getting more control over the data that tends to cloud/muddle our lives. 
During 2012 we launched Vestigo (yes, we actually eat our own dog food) and began moving forward 
with BlockTracker with respective 2013 product launches.
