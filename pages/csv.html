File format for CSV uploads<p>
In general, try not to upload CSVs of more than 500 items at a time. Larger files are unsupported and may fail.<p>
CSV upload is incremental. If you upload the same rows twice, you will have duplicates.<p>
CSV upload doesn't support all columns that normal addition does. This is a great way to quickly get a list of items into the system.<p>
