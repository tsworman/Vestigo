          What do you do with my data?<br>
          Right now, not much. If this changes we will post here before that. We let you maintain it, update, delete, import/export it.<br>
          We only use your data to help us populate the shared meta data.<br>
          If you add a new Artist on one of your items and we don't have it, we will eventually add that artist to the shared list<br>
          <p>
          How do I request a feature or new type of item?<br>
          Send an email to support@novaslp.net<br>
