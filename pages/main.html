Vestigo is a multi-platform service (Smart Phone & Web) designed to allow users to easily inventory, track and manage both physical assets (tool, furniture, electronics, books, toys, etc.) and references to electronic assets (currently, there is no plan to allow for the storage of electronic media like MP3's, eBooks, personal files, etc.).<p>
Capabilities include categorization, tracking repairs, managing warranties, storing images of items, loading asset details by scanning a UPC, share details with personal network, and ever creating a 'wish list' (note: integration with Amazon?).
